🚔 Data-Driven Analysis of Fatal Police Shootings in the U.S.  
Advanced Machine Learning & Data Science Techniques for Societal Impact

🔥 Why This Project Matters  
Fatal police shootings remain a critical issue in public safety. This project leverages data science & machine learning to uncover patterns in race, gender, geography, and law enforcement interactions.
By utilizing K-Means Clustering & Logistic Regression, we aim to analyze, visualize, and predict key aspects of these incidents.  

📊 Project Summary  
✅ Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Trends in race, gender, & location  
✅ Geospatial Analysis: Heatmaps & clustering of incidents  
✅ Machine Learning Models:
    1. K-Means Clustering → Identifying high-risk locations  
    2. Logistic Regression → Predicting threat type & weapon use 
     
✅ Key Findings: Police shootings disproportionately impact men & urban communities
